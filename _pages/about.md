Hi, my name is Jerome Bizimana and I am a third year computer science major at Northwestern University. My areas of concentration in Computer Science are Software engineering and Human Computer Interaction. With those two concentrations together with my knowledge in building secure systems, I aim to build usable systems for everyone.
