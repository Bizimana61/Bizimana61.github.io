Hi — I’m **Jerome Bizimana**, a junior studying **Computer Science at Northwestern University** (Class of 2027).

I focus on **Software Engineering + Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** because I care about two things at the same time: building systems that are technically solid *and* systems that people can actually use. I’m especially excited by web applications that move from idea → prototype → user feedback → production.

**A few things that characterize me**

- **Human-centered builder:** I like designing simple flows, testing them with users, and iterating quickly.
- **Security-aware engineer:** I think about practical risks early (input validation, auth, safe defaults), not as an afterthought.
- **Global perspective:** I’m from **Burundi** and I speak **English, French, Swahili, Kirundi, and Kinyarwanda**.
- **Team energy:** I’m sociable, enjoy collaborating, and I love hanging out with friends.

**Right now**

I’m working on a team project called **CouponMaxxing**, an app to help college students track coupon deadlines so they can use discounts before they expire.

Outside of class and projects, I play soccer for fun, follow **Liverpool FC**, and I’m a big fan of solar system topics.
