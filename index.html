excerpt: "Computer Science @ Northwestern (’27). I build usable, secure web applications at the intersection of Software Engineering and Human–Computer Interaction."

intro:
  - excerpt: "I’m a junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science, with a focus on **Software Engineering + HCI**—I care about building systems that real people can actually use. I’m from **Burundi**, speak **five languages** (English, French, Swahili, Kirundi, Kinyarwanda), and I’m usually down to talk soccer (Liverpool fan) or prototype the next idea."

feature_row:
  - title: "Human-centered software"
    excerpt: "I start with users: clear flows, thoughtful UI, and fast iteration—then I ship clean, maintainable implementations."
  - title: "Full-stack + security mindset"
    excerpt: "I build web apps end-to-end (frontend, APIs, auth) with practical security habits inspired by the OWASP Top 10."
  - title: "Builder + teammate"
    excerpt: "I’m collaborative and energetic—whether that’s user testing, pairing on a tricky bug, or getting a deployment over the finish line."

design_row:
  - title: "Clarity"
    excerpt: "Simple information hierarchy, readable typography, and calm pages that help users find what they need quickly."
  - title: "Feedback"
    excerpt: "Interfaces should explain what’s happening—especially when AI is involved (transparent suggestions, reversible actions)."
  - title: "Accessibility"
    excerpt: "Keyboard-friendly flows, strong contrast, and sensible defaults so more people can use the product comfortably."
